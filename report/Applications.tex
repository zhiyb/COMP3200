This technique can be applied to vision based robotic and interactive embedded systems, where power consumption and reaction latency are essential. By enabling adaptive frame rate and resolution control, the processing power hence the total power consumption can be dramatically reduced, by not having to continuously process video stream at high frame rate and resolution when it is not necessary. In addition, by executing some of computer vision algorithms on board instead of remote compute server, low latency reactions on such system can be achieved.

This technique may also be applied to bandwidth efficient video streaming applications, for example video surveillance and conferencing. In such applications, .
