\begin{abstract}
Object detection and tracking is a key technique used in computer vision applications, especially robotic systems, artificial intelligence and video surveillance systems, but video processing algorithms require a lot of computations, consume a significant amount of energy. This project was purposed to reduce power consumption and possibly improves performance of camera based real-time object detection and tracking applications. Such an application may rely heavily on battery power or harvesting energy from environment, hence power consumption on those devices becomes critical. As battery technology development was not as fast as electronic processing technology development, lower power consumption implies longer battery life for mobile devices e.g. laptops and smart phones, also lower environmental impact.

This project investigated some hardware based methodologies to achieve an overall reduction of computations required for doing continuous real-time object detection and tracking, includes dynamical control of hardware downsampling and cropping provided by the camera controller, automatic camera sleeping and frame rate reduction based on whether objects detected, their location and moving speed relative to the camera sense.
